Used for academic collaboration on a project of human activity recognition with triaxial accelerometers.

<h3>Notes</h3>
Viewing "raw/bites/graph/1.png" shows that something went awry with the data collection for that particular participant. I am not sure why. You'll notice that it isn't accounted for in "parse/bites". I did graph it so you could see why. However, we may still decide to use it later on.
